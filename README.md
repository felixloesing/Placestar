Placestar is a great way to save and remember the Places you enjoyed visiting.

You can only tag your current location, therefore it is a proof that you visited a certain Location. After saving a new place, you can add a category and a photo to complete your entry.

You can track all your bookmarked places on a map and using a list view. Below that, you can see more details and a small preview of your saved photo.

It is built using modern iOS technologies and can handle all the places you will visit in your life and will also respect your privacy. Your data is yours and is never shared - ideal as a personal travel diary.
