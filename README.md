You can track all your bookmarked places on a map and on the list. Below you can see more details and a small preview of your saved photo.

Built using modern iOS technologies, Placestar can handle all the places you will visit in your life and will also respect your privacy. Your data is yours and is never shared - ideal as a personal diary.
